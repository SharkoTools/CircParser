# CircParser
CircParser: a novel streamlined pipeline for circular RNA structure and host gene prediction in non-model organisms

  CircParser is simple and fast pipeline that uses the outputs from the most common circular RNAs in silico prediction tools (CIRI, CIRI2, CircExplorer2, find_circ, and circFinder) to annotate circular RNAs, assigning
presumable host genes from local or public databases such as National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Also this pipeline can discriminate circular RNAs
based on their structural components (exonic, intronic, exon-intronic or intergenic) using genome annotation file.
